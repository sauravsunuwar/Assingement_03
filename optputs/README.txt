HIT137 Assignment 3 – Output Images

This folder contains sample output images generated using the
Image Editor Application developed for HIT137 Assignment 3.

The images demonstrate the correct functioning of the application,
including:

- Grayscale conversion
- Canny edge detection (default and slider-based thresholds)
- Brightness and contrast adjustments
- Image resizing and rotation
- Zoom (view-only) functionality

All images in this folder were generated using the GUI via
File → Save / Save As.

Note:
Zoom functionality affects display only and does not modify
the saved image, as required by the assignment.
